Bugger
======

A simple task logger (currently only) for osx

As often as you feel is needed, by default every 15m, a notification shows your current task and time spent.
You can activate the notification to add a new current task and the last will be ended.
Then you can get a rapport -> Profit.

# Installation OSX

```
$ [sudo] brew install qt
$ [sudo] gem install qtbindings
$ [sudo] gem install terminal-notifier
$ [sudo] gem install SQLite3
$ [sudo] gem install launchy
$ ./bugadm install
```

And you are good to go!

# Usage

You should add bugadm to path, then:
bugadm (install|load|unload|reload|status|prompt|notify|rapport)

bugadm (prompt|rapport) should cover your basic needs.

# TODO


- [x] Db rewrite to BCNF and use unixtime instead of DateTime
- [ ] Add support for keywords
- [x] Take sleep/poweroff into account
- [x] Account for idletime
- [ ] Make platform independent
